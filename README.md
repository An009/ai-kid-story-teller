## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* A Supabase project
* A Cohere API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-kid-story-teller.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-kid-story-teller.git)
    cd ai-kid-story-teller
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase and Cohere credentials:

    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    COHERE_API_KEY="YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"
    ```

    * You can find your `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your Supabase project settings.
    * Obtain your `COHERE_API_KEY` from the Cohere dashboard.

4.  **Set up Supabase Database and Functions:**
    The project uses Supabase for authentication, database storage (for user stories), and Edge Functions for AI story generation.

    * **Database Schema**: Apply the SQL migrations located in `supabase/migrations/` to your Supabase project. These define the `stories` and `user_preferences` tables and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
        * `20250622191702_royal_lab.sql`: Initial schema for stories and user preferences.
        * `20250623011029_white_spark.sql`: Updates to allow guest users and fix foreign key constraints.
    * **Supabase Edge Functions**: Deploy the functions located in `supabase/functions/` to your Supabase project. These handle story generation, saving, fetching, updating, and deleting.
        * `generate-story/index.ts`
        * `save-story/index.ts`
        * `get-user-stories/index.ts`
        * `update-story/index.ts`
        * `delete-story/index.ts`
        * Remember to set `COHERE_API_KEY` as a secret in your Supabase project's Edge Functions settings.
